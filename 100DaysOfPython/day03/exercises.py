age = input('Enter your age: ')

# Check the data type of the age

# Convert the 'age' to a number

# Double the age

# Divide the age by 2

# What happens if you try floor division by 2?

# What happens if you raise (exponent) the age to itself?

# What is the remainder of the age divided by 3?

# Fix the following to get the original age
original_age = age * age - age / age + age
