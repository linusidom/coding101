# Basic Syntax
# if True:

# 	'''
# 	# Everything inside if statement
# 	# Needs to be indented

# 	Parentheses are optional
# 	'''
	
# 	# This is inside the If statement
# 	print(True)


# # This is outside the If statement
# print(False)


# Example 2 - Conditions
# if this

# 	then do something

# else if this
# 	then do something

# else
# 	then do something

# a = 65

# if ( a < 65):
# 	# When a is under 65
# 	print('You cannot retire yet')
# elif (a > 65):
# 	# When a is over 65
# 	print('You can now retire')
# else:
# 	# When a is = 65
# 	print('You have to wait just a bit longer')


# a = 21

# if (a < 21):
# 	# When a is less than
# 	print('You cannot drink')
# elif (a >= 21):
# 	# When a is Greater than or equal to
# 	print('You can drink')



# a = 20
# b = 20

# a = 'passw0rd'
# b = 'passw0rd'


# a = [1,2,3]
# b = [1,2,3,4]

a = {'k1':'val1'}
b = {'k1':'val2'}


# if (a == b):
# 	print('Both are equal')
# else:
# 	print('Not equal')
# elif(a != b):
# 	print('Not equal')


# Indentation is the most important component of Python Logic Functions


# if Condition 1 is met:
	
# 	do this

# 	# This is both indented and under the if statement

# # ElIf on the same level as the If Statement
# elif condition 1 is not met and condition 2 is met:

# 	do this
# 	# This is both indented and under the if statement

# # Else on the same level as the If Statement
# else condition 1 and condition 2 are not met
# 	do this





# elif a == b:
# 	print('Both are equal')



# else:
# 	print('Both are not equal')	


# if a:
# 	do something
# elif b:
# 	do something
# elif b < a:
# 	do something
# elif a <= c:
# 	do something
# else:
# 	do something
