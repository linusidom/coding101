Test API's and Components
We should be building out our Tests and then the components but for this video since it's an introduction I am going to do this wrong and do development backwards and not practice TDD intentionally and other cases we'll do development in true TDD fashion

- Express API Endpoint testing with a Fake Database
- React Basic Component Testing
- Redux action and reducer testing
- React Component with Redux Integration testing
- Selenium UI Testing

# Move into Components and Redux and build the app
- Building the app out first and then testing because the concepts are difficult to understand the first time around so that's why I'm intentionally doing this backwards from what is recommended in Test Driven Development
- Build out the Redux store for the app and alert components
- Build out the components for the posts app and alert
